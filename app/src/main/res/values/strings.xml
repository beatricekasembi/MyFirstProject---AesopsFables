        Two neighbours came before Jupiter and prayed him to grant their hearts desire. Now the one was full of avarice, and the other eaten up with envy.\n\n

So to punish them both, Jupiter granted that each might have whatever he wished for himself, but only on condition that his neighbour had twice as much.

The Avaricious man prayed to have a room full of gold.\n\n

No sooner said than done; but all his joy was turned to grief when he found that his neighbour had two rooms full of the precious metal.

Then came the turn of the Envious man, who could not bear to think that his neighbour had any joy at all.\n\n

So he prayed that he might have one of his own eyes put out, by which means his companion would become totally blind.\n\n

        A Lion once fell in love with a beautiful maiden and proposed marriage to her parents.

The old people did not know what to say.\n\n

They did not like to give their daughter to the Lion, yet they did not wish to enrage the King of Beasts.\n\n

At last the father said:

"We feel highly honoured by your Majesty's proposal, but you see our daughter is a tender young thing, and we fear that in the vehemence of your affection you might possibly do her some injury. Might I venture to suggest that your Majesty should have your claws removed, and your teeth extracted, then we would gladly consider your proposal again."

The Lion was so much in love that he had his claws trimmed and his big teeth taken out.\n\n

But when he came again to the parents of the young girl they simply laughed in his face, and bade him do his worst.

       There was once a Bald Man who sat down after work on a hot summers day.\n\n

A Fly came up and kept buzzing about his bald pate, and stinging him from time to time.

The Man aimed a blow at his little enemy, but his palm came on his head instead.\n\n

Again the Fly tormented him, but this time the Man was wiser and said:

"You will only injure yourself if you take notice of despicable enemies."

        At a country fair there was a Buffoon who made all the people laugh by imitating the cries of various animals.\n\n

He finished off by squeaking so like a pig that the spectators thought that he had a porker concealed about him.\n\n

But a Countryman who stood by said:

"Call that a pig's squeak! Nothing like it. You give me till tomorrow and I will show you what it's like."\n\n

The audience laughed, but next day, sure enough, the Countryman appeared on the stage, and putting his head down squealed so hideously that the spectators hissed and threw stones at him to make him stop.

"You fools!" he cried, "see what you have been hissing," and held up a little pig whose ear he had been pinching to make him utter the squeals.\n\n

        A Man came into a Wood one day with an axe in his hand, and begged all the Trees to give him a small branch which he wanted for a particular purpose.\n\n

The Trees were good-natured and gave him one of their branches.\n\n

What did the Man do but fix it into the axe head, and soon set to work cutting down tree after tree.\n\n

Then the Trees saw how foolish they had been in giving their enemy the means of destroying themselves.\n\n

       A Dog used to run up quietly to the heels of those he met, and to bite them without notice.\n\n

His master sometimes suspended a bell about his neck, that he might give notice of his presence wherever he went, and sometimes he fastened a chain about his neck, to which was attached a heavy clog, so that he could not be so quick at biting peoples heels.\n

The Dog grew proud of his bell and clog and went with them all over the market place.\n\n

An old hound said to him: "Why do you make such an exhibition of yourself? That bell and clog that you carry are not believe me, orders of merit, but, on the contrary, marks of disgrace, a public notice to all men to avoid you as an ill-mannered dog."

        A young Man had been caught in a daring act of theft and had been condemned to be executed for it.\n\n

He expressed his desire to see his Mother, and to speak with her before he was led to execution, and of course this was granted.\n\n

When his Mother came to him he said: "I want to whisper to you," and when she brought her ear near him, he nearly bit it off. All the bystanders were horrified, and asked him what he could mean by such brutal and inhuman conduct.\n

"It is to punish her," he said.\n "When I was young I began with stealing little things, and brought them home to Mother. Instead of rebuking and punishing me, she laughed and said: It will not be noticed. It is because of her that I am here to-day."\n

"He is right, woman," said the Priest; "the Lord hath said: Train up a child in the way he should go; and when he is old he will not depart therefrom."\n\n

       A Doe had had the misfortune to lose one of her eyes, and could not see any one approaching her on that side.\n\n

So to avoid any danger she always used to feed on a high cliff near the sea, with her sound eye looking towards the land.\n\n

By this means she could see whenever the hunters approached her on land, and often escaped by this means.\n

But the hunters found out that she was blind of one eye, and hiring a boat rowed under the cliff where she used to feed and shot her from the sea.

"Ah," cried she with her dying voice: "You cannot escape your fate."\n\n

        It happened that a Fox caught its tail in a trap, and in struggling to release himself lost all of it but the stump.\n\n

At first he was ashamed to show himself among his fellow foxes.\n\n

But at last he determined to put a bolder face upon his misfortune, and summoned all the foxes to a general meeting to consider a proposal which he had to place before them.\n

When they had assembled together the Fox proposed that they should all do away with their tails.\n\n

He pointed out how inconvenient a tail was when they were pursued by their enemies, the dogs; how much it was in the way when they desired to sit down and hold a friendly conversation with one another.\n

He failed to see any advantage in carrying about such a useless encumbrance. \n\n

"That is all very well," said one of the older foxes; "but I do not think you would have recommended us to dispense with our chief ornament if you had not happened to lose it yourself."

        A Man came into a forest, and made a petition to the Trees to provide him a handle for his axe.\n\n

The Trees consented to his request, and gave him a young ash-tree.\n\n

No sooner had the man fitted from it a new handle to his axe, than he began to use it, and quickly felled with his strokes the noblest giants of the forest.\n

An old oak, lamenting when too late the destruction of his companions, said to a neighboring cedar:\n\n

"The first step has lost us all. If we had not given up the rights of the ash, we might yet have retained our own privileges and have stood for ages."\n
